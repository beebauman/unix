# server-backup.sh rsync filter rules list

# For syntax help, see developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/rsync.1.html,
# specifically, the "FILTER RULES" section.

# --------------------------------------------------#

# Include all directories. Otherwise, inclusions of multilevel paths won't work. This will
# include lots of empty directories that we don't want, but they'll all be removed
# with rsync's --prune-empty-dirs option.
+ */

# My personal /var/www include/exclude included here as an example:

# The first directive says "exclude all contents of /var/www/frameworks." *** means 
# recursive. This exclusion rule must be placed before the subsequent inclusion 
# rule for /var/www, because rsync only processes each path once. Whatever filter 
# rule it encounters for a path (include or exclude) is final. So, in summary, the 
# following two rules say "include everything in /var/www, except for /var/www/frameworks."
- /var/www/frameworks/***
+ /var/www/***

# These two rules include the crontab and database backup files created by unixme
# when using the backup script's --crontab and --databases options.
+ /var/backups/crontabs/***
+ /var/backups/mysql/***

# Other files you might want to include in your backups:

# unixme itself (for example, in case you've modified the default firewall rules)
+ /unixme/***

# Apache's global configuration and configured sites, and PHP's configuration file
+ /etc/apache2/sites-available/***
+ /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
+ /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

# Networking configuration
+ /etc/hostname
+ /etc/hosts
+ /etc/network/***
+ /etc/resolv.conf

# Postfix configuration
+ /etc/postfix/main.cf

# sudo configuration
+ /etc/sudoers

# OpenVPN configuration files
+ /etc/openvpn/***

# User account home directories
+ /home/***

# System crontab
+ /etc/crontab

# System cronjob directories
+ /etc/cron.d/***
+ /etc/cron.hourly/***
+ /etc/cron.daily/***
+ /etc/cron.weekly/***
+ /etc/cron.monthly/***

# Lastly, we remove all files not explicitly included. Otherwise, every single file not
# explicitly excluded will be included.
